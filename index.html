    <h1>Carlos Rosado</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a self-taught software developer with a passion for learning and growth. I have completed comprehensive courses on Udemy and freeCodeCamp where I have learned programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS. By practicing on platforms such as LeetCode and GitHub, I have honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, which has provided me with a strong foundation of theoretical knowledge alongside real-world experience. I have a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals, and my self-directed learning journey has equipped me with the agility and adaptability needed to thrive in dynamic tech environments.
        I am driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to contribute to cutting-edge projects. I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded professionals and expand my skill set. I am committed to lifelong learning and am enthusiastic about the prospect of embarking on a rewarding career journey as a professional software developer.
